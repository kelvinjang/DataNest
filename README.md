### Module 1 - Conversion Tracker:
- In Dragon Nest, players get to open 3 conversion boxes every day - 1 armor box, 1 wtd box (wings/tail/decal), and 1 acc box (accessory)  
- When opened, players will receive a random number (from 10 - 100) of fragments corresponding to the box type (armor boxes give armor fragments, etc.)  
- This module aims to help players keep track of the number of fragments received and estimate how lucky or unlucky a player is according to probability data
